This is a tool for scraping images from RigExpert IT-24, AA-170, and maybe other analyzers.
Once started, it'll log all images from the analyzer sent over USB to a series of
image files, until terminated.

Before using, you need to do the following:
	Install packages listed in DEPENDENCIES
	
Before using, you need to know the following:
	Analyzer Baud Rate
	USB<->Serial port name

To list program options, run `python scraper.py --help`

Important Options:
	--port <portname>
		This tells the program how to connect to the analyzer.
		Windows: COMn
		Linux: /dev/ttyUSBn

	--baud <baudrate>
		<baudrate> needs to match the rate for your analyzer. AA-170 uses 38400 and
		IT-24 uses 115200(if --baud is not used, 115200 is assumed)
